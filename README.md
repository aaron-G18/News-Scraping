# News-Scraping

This app lets you scrape articles from NPR.org and it displays them for the user. The User can then choose to save articles or clear unsaved articles from the home page. Clicking on the "Saved Articles" button will take the user to the saved articles page. This page will list all saved articles with options to delete all saved articles, delete an individual article, or save notes on an individual article.

The main focus of this project was to utilize MongoDB (noSQL database) and Mongoose (MongoDB object modeling for Node.js) to handle interaction between the front end UI and the server side database, and also to use Axios (promise based HTTP client) and Cheerio (tool for parsing and traversing scraped data) for web scraping.
